# Feel Better

Feel Better is the first app I have created on my own and I'm planning to deploy without collaboration. 

It is coming from a place of love. My genuine wish is to make it as accessible and helpful as possible. 

## Rececntly Achieved:

- form for heavylifter displaying correctly
- adding tick boxes to lightbringer; making random suggestions displaying uniquely and properly. 
- customised form submitting and displaying correctly;
- checkboxes working and submission messages displaying.

## In Progress

- adding SASS
- commenting code

## Next Steps: 

- creating 'how are you' item - where person can say how they are feeling now
- adding private journaling section
- 404 page
