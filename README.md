# Feel Better

Feel Better is the first app I have created on my own and I'm planning to deploy without collaboration. 

It is coming from a place of love. My genuine wish is to make it as accessible and helpful as possible. 

## Rececntly Achieved:

- created an database of helpful suggestions
- make it appear in correct way
- welcome page and toggling working
- navigation
- form for heavylifter displaying correctly
- adding tick boxes to lightbringer; making random suggestions displaying uniquely and properly. 
- adding titles, subtitles and pictures


## In Progress

- commenting code
- finishing customised form for heavylifter 

## Current Issues:
- creating the form that saves the values to the database; 
- making sure that the response comes back with the correct data

## Next Steps: 

- 404 page 
- appling css and sass
