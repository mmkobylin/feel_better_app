        Maybe you just just got most of your ducks in order. Maybe it is the other way around, you used to and now they seem to be having a rave. Maybe you just need something to keep you in the routine. <br>
        This is what I created a <a class="navbar-brand" href="/heavylifter">HEAVYLIFTER</a> for. <br><br>
        I created a list of checking boxes, that you might tick, and get the score you had after each day. 
        It is ok if some of them don't apply. This is your journey. 
        <br><br>
        But what if you are thinking... nah, this sounds good, but I know I feel good only when I sleep 4 hours and do all the food prep in the world! This does not seem to match my needs at all! <br>
        Well worry not, with thought of you and adventures spirits, I had created a questionare:
        <br><a class="nav-home" id="hideaway" href="/heavy-custom">Pick your own adventure?!</a>
        <br>Please use it and have fun, who am I to tell you how to live your life?
