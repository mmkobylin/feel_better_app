    <h1>Welcome to Feel Better!</h1>

    <h2>How does it help?</h2>

        <section>
            <p>My first goal with this app is to try my best to help anyone in a dark place. (cause I've been there). <br>
                For that go to <a class="navbar" href="/lightbringer">LIGHTBRINGER</a>
            </p>
        
            <h3 id="subtitle1" style="display: block k">Tell me more!</h3>
            <p id='extend-paragraph1' style="display: block ">
            Let's say you have been in a dark place. Might be for a week. Might be for a month, or you really don't know for how long.
            But it has been attrocious. You have eaten all takeaway. Or opposite, nearly nothing at all. You don't remember when you washed your hair. The house is a mess. You still are not exactly energetic, but the reality had come knocking on the door. <br>
            First of all, I feel you. This is what the <a class="navbar" href="/lightbringer">LIGHTBRINGER</a>. is design for! I wanted to create an app where by simple and cheap or free steps you are able to feel just a little bit better. Maybe not every day, but often enough.</p>

            <p> My second goal is to help people to step up their game after they got better! Now when you might want to stretch yourself little further.<br>
                <br>For that go to <a class="navbar" href="/heavylifter">HEAVYLIFTER</a>.
            </p>

            <h3 id="subtitle2" style="display: block k">Tell me more!</h3>
            <p id="extend-paragraph2" style="display: block ">
                Maybe you just just got most of your ducks in order. Maybe it is the other way around, you used to and now they seem to be having a rave. Maybe you just need something to keep you in the routine. <br>
                This is what I created a <a class="navbar" href="/heavylifter">HEAVYLIFTER</a> for. <br>
                I created a list of checking boxes, that you might tick, and get the score you had after each day. 
                It is ok if some of them don't apply. This is your journey. 
                If you prefer to <br><a class="nav-home" href="/heavy-custom">Pick your own adventure</a><br>
                Just click on link and put some of your own ideas of things that will make you feel better!
