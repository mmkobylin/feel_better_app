        <h4>My first goal with this app is to try my best to help anyone in a dark place, cause I've been there myself. <br>
            <br>For that go to <a class="nav link" href="/lightbringer">LIGHTBRINGER</a>.
        </h4><br>

        <h4 id="subtitle1"> 
            <span id=span1 style="display: block">Tell me more! </span>
            <span id=span2 style="display: none">Got it, thanks! </span>
        </h4>
        <p id='paragraph1' style="display: none">
        Let's say you have been in a dark place. Might have been for a week, a month, or you've just lost track of how long it's been.
        'You've eaten nothing but takeaway/junk food, or done the opposite and barely eaten at all. You don't remember when you washed your hair. The house is a mess. You're really lacking energy.... but then the reality had come knocking on the door. <br>
        First of all, I feel you. This is what the <a class="link" href="/lightbringer">LIGHTBRINGER</a> is designed for! I wanted to create an app where by simple and cheap or free steps you are able to feel just a little bit better. Maybe not every day, but often enough.

        <h4> My second goal is to help people to step up their game after if they feel up for it!<br>
            <br>For that go to <a class="link" href="/heavylifter">HEAVYLIFTER</a>.
        </h4><br>

        <h4 id="subtitle2"> 
            <span id=span3 style="display: block">Tell me more! </span>
            <span id=span4 style="display: none">Got it, thanks! </span>

            Maybe you just just got most of your ducks in order. Maybe it is the other way around, you used to and now they seem to be having a rave. Maybe you just need something to keep you in the routine. <br>
            This is what I created a <a class="link" href="/heavylifter">HEAVYLIFTER</a> for. <br>
            I created a items to be checked off on a list every day, like part of a healthier daily routine.
            You get the score you had after each day. 
            It is ok if some of items don't apply. This is your journey. 
            If you prefer to <br><a class="nav-home link" href="/form">pick your own adventure</a><br>
            Just click on link and put some of your own ideas of things that will make you feel better!
