        Use your own guidance and common sense. You got 'go for the walk' but you are living in Alberta and it is - 40 degrees? Probably not the best
        idea, try again. Same goes for issues with self-esteem, anxiety, eating disorders and such. BUT. Unless it would be stupid or dangerous, please at least try to fullfill the dot. More dots mean you are on the way to feeling better, even if you're not sure you are on the right track. 
        <br>

        Overall, I want you to know that THIS IS A PROCESS. And you will never get it done, it will never be perfect, and that's ok.<br>
        It's about feeling better rather than being perfect. My genuine wish for you is to enjoy this journey, and go as far as you want, at your own pace. 
        <br><br>
        I know this is not easy. I am proud of you for looking for help.<br> <br>

        Another thing that this is not, is a training programme or eating programme. I believe that health can be improved and happiness can be found in any size, shape and ability level. 
        That's why I'm using term: 'eat HEALTHIER' not ' healthy', because you can do this at your own pace, to your own level.
        If you finally ate a home-made, healthier meal instead of takeout? Great job!
